User Management {#HttpUserIntro}
================================

This is an introduction to ArangoDB's Http interface for managing users.

The interface provides a simple means to add, update, and remove users.
All users managed through this interface will be stored in the system 
collection `_users`.

This specialised interface intentionally does not provide all functionality 
that is available in the regular document REST API.

Operations on users may become more restricted than regular document operations, 
and extra privileges and security security checks may be introduced in the 
future for this interface.

Please note that user operations are not included in ArangoDB's replication.
