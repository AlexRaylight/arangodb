COMMAND SECTION "DATE" "" "ArangoDB"
NAME
COMMAND - a tool to create logical dumps of an ArangoDB database
SYNOPSIS
COMMAND [options] 
DESCRIPTION
The COMMAND binary can be used to create logical dumps of collection
meta information and collection data (documents) of an ArangoDB database.
By default, all non-system collections of the specified ArangoDB database
will be dumped with structural information and data. 

For each collection, a file named "<collection>.structure.json" will be
created with information about the collection. When data is also dumped,
an additional file "<collection>.data.json" will also be created.
All dump files will be placed in a directory, which will be created by
COMMAND when run. If the directory already exists, COMMAND will refuse to
work unless started with the option "--overwrite true".

COMMAND will work on the specified database only. If no database name
is specified, COMMAND will work on the default database ("_system").

The dumped files can be re-stored in an ArangoDB database using the
arangorestore tool.
