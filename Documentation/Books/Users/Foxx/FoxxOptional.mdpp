!SUBSECTION FormatMiddleware

To use this plugin, please require it first:

```js
  FormatMiddleware = require("org/arangodb/foxx/template_middleware").FormatMiddleware;
```

This Middleware gives you Rails-like format handling via the *extension* of 
the URL or the accept header. Say you request an URL like */people.json*:

The *FormatMiddleware* will set the format of the request to JSON and then 
delete the *.json* from the request. You can therefore write handlers that 
do not take an *extension* into consideration and instead handle the 
format via a simple string. To determine the format of the request it 
checks the URL and then the *accept* header. If one of them gives a format 
or both give the same, the format is set. If the formats are not the same, 
an error is raised.

Use it by calling:

```js
FormatMiddleware = require('foxx').FormatMiddleware;
app.before(FormatMiddleware.new(['json']));
```

In both forms you can give a default format as a second parameter, if no 
format could be determined. If you give no *defaultFormat* this case will be 
handled as an error.  

!SUBSECTION TemplateMiddleware

To use this plugin, please require it first:

```js
TemplateMiddleware = require("org/arangodb/foxx/template_middleware").TemplateMiddleware;
```

The *TemplateMiddleware* can be used to give a Foxx.Controller the capability 
of using templates. Currently you can only use Underscore Templates.  It 
expects documents in the following form in this collection:

```js
{
  path: "high/way",
  content: "hello <%= username %>",
  contentType: "text/plain",
  templateLanguage: "underscore"
}
```

The *content* is the string that will be rendered by the template processor. 
The *contentType* is the type of content that results from this call. And with 
the *templateLanguage* you can choose your template processor. There is only 
one choice now: *underscore*.  Which would set the body of the response to 
*hello Controller* with the template defined above. It will also set the 
*contentType* to *text/plain* in this case.  In addition to the attributes 
you provided, you also have access to all your view helpers.
