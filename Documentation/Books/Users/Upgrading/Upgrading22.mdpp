!CHAPTER Upgrading to ArangoDB 2.1

Please read the following sections if you upgrade from a previous version to
ArangoDB 2.2.

Please note first that a database directory used with ArangoDB 2.2
cannot be used with earlier versions (e.g. ArangoDB 2.1) any
more. Upgrading a database directory cannot be reverted. Therefore
please make sure to create a full backup of your existing ArangoDB
installation before performing an upgrade.
