# Command-Line Options for Development

`--development-mode`

Specifying this option will start the server in development mode. The development mode forces reloading of all actions and Foxx applications on every HTTP request. This is very resource-intensive and slow, but makes developing server-side actions and Foxx applications much easier.

Never use this option in production.
