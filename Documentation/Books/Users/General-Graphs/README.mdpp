!CHAPTER General Graphs

This chapter describes the multi-collection graph module.
It allows you to define a graph that is spread across several edge and document collections.
This allows you to structure your models in line with your domain and group them logically in collections and giving you the power to query them in the same graph queries.
There is no need to include the referenced collections within the query, this module will handle it for you.
