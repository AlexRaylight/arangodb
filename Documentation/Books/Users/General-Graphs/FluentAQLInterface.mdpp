!CHAPTER Fluent AQL Interface

This chapter describes a fluent interface to query your graph.
The philosophy of this interface is to select a group of starting elements (vertices or edges) at first and from there on explore the graph with your query by selecting connected elements.

As an example you can start with a set of vertices, select their direct neighbors and finally their outgoing edges.

The result of this query will be the set of outgoing edges.
For each part of the query it is possible to further refine the resulting set of elements by giving examples for them.

!SECTION Starting Points

This section describes the entry points for the fluent interface.
The philosophy of this module is to start with a specific subset of vertices or edges and from there on iterate over the graph.

Therefore you get exactly this two entry points:

* Select a set of edges
* Select a set of vertices

!SUBSECTION  Edges

<!-- @startDocuBlock JSF_general_graph_edges -->

Select some edges from the graph.
<br />
Creates an AQL statement to select a subset of the edges stored in the graph.
This is one of the entry points for the fluent AQL interface.
It will return a mutable AQL statement which can be further refined, using the
functions described below.
The resulting set of edges can be filtered by defining one or more `examples`.
<br />
`examples` can have the following values:
<br />
* Empty, there is no matching executed all edges are valid.
* A string, only the edge having this value as it's id is returned.
* An example object, defining a set of attributes.
Only edges having these attributes are matched.
* A list containing example objects and/or strings.
All edges matching at least one of the elements in the list are returned.
<br />
@EXAMPLES
<br />
In the examples the `toArray` function is used to print the result.
The description of this module can be found below.
<br />
To request unfiltered edges:
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphEdgesUnfiltered}
var examples = require("orgarangodbgraph-examplesexample-graph.js");
var g = examples.loadGraph("social");
g._edges().toArray();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<br />
To request filtered edges:
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphEdgesUnfiltered}
var examples = require("orgarangodbgraph-examplesexample-graph.js");
var g = examples.loadGraph("social");
g._edges({type: "married"}).toArray();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<!-- @endDocuBlock -->

!SUBSECTION Vertices

<!-- @startDocuBlock JSF_general_graph_vertices -->

Select some vertices from the graph.
<br />
Creates an AQL statement to select a subset of the vertices stored in the graph.
This is one of the entry points for the fluent AQL interface.
It will return a mutable AQL statement which can be further refined, using the
functions described below.
The resulting set of edges can be filtered by defining one or more `examples`.
<br />
`examples` can have the following values:
<br />
* Empty, there is no matching executed all vertices are valid.
* A string, only the vertex having this value as it's id is returned.
* An example object, defining a set of attributes.
Only vertices having these attributes are matched.
* A list containing example objects and/or strings.
All vertices matching at least one of the elements in the list are returned.
<br />
@EXAMPLES
<br />
In the examples the `toArray` function is used to print the result.
The description of this module can be found below.
<br />
To request unfiltered vertices:
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphVerticesUnfiltered}
var examples = require("orgarangodbgraph-examplesexample-graph.js");
var g = examples.loadGraph("social");
g._vertices().toArray();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<br />
To request filtered vertices:
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphVerticesUnfiltered}

@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<!-- @endDocuBlock -->

!SECTION Working with the query cursor

The fluent query object handles cursor creation and maintenance for you.
A cursor will be created as soon as you request the first result.
If you are unhappy with the current result and want to refine it further you can execute a further step in the query which cleans up the cursor for you.
In this interface you get the complete functionality available for general AQL cursors directly on your query.
The cursor functionality is described in this section.

!SUBSECTION ToArray

<!-- @startDocuBlock JSF_general_graph_fluent_aql_toArray -->

Returns an array containing the complete result.
<br />
This function executes the generated query and returns the
entire result as one array.
ToArray does not return the generated query anymore and
hence can only be the endpoint of a query.
However keeping a reference to the query before
executing allows to chain further statements to it.
<br />
@EXAMPLES
<br />
To collect the entire result of a query toArray can be used:
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphFluentAQLToArray}
var examples = require("orgarangodbgraph-examplesexample-graph.js");
var g = examples.loadGraph("social");
var query = g._vertices();
query.toArray();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<!-- @endDocuBlock -->

!SUBSECTION HasNext

<!-- @startDocuBlock JSF_general_graph_fluent_aql_hasNext -->

Checks if the query has further results.
<br />
The generated statement maintains a cursor for you.
If this cursor is already present `hasNext()` will
use this cursors position to determine if there are
further results available.
If the query has not yet been executed `hasNext()`
will execute it and create the cursor for you.
<br />
@EXAMPLES
<br />
Start query execution with hasNext:
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphFluentAQLToArray}
var examples = require("orgarangodbgraph-examplesexample-graph.js");
var g = examples.loadGraph("social");
var query = g._vertices();
query.hasNext();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<br />
Iterate over the result as long as it has more elements:
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphFluentAQLToArray}
var examples = require("orgarangodbgraph-examplesexample-graph.js");
var g = examples.loadGraph("social");
var query = g._vertices();
while(query.hasNext()) {
query.next();
}
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<!-- @endDocuBlock -->

!SUBSECTION Next

<!-- @startDocuBlock JSF_general_graph_fluent_aql_next -->

Request the next element in the result
<br />
The generated statement maintains a cursor for you.
If this cursor is already present `next()` will
use this cursors position to deliver the next result.
Also the cursor position will be moved by one.
If the query has not yet been executed `next()`
will execute it and create the cursor for you.
It will throw an error of your query has no further results.
<br />
@EXAMPLES
<br />
Request some elements with next:
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphFluentAQLToArray}
var examples = require("orgarangodbgraph-examplesexample-graph.js");
var g = examples.loadGraph("social");
var query = g._vertices();
query.next();
query.next();
query.next();
query.next();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<br />
The cursor is recreated if the query is changed.
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphFluentAQLToArray}
var examples = require("orgarangodbgraph-examplesexample-graph.js");
var g = examples.loadGraph("social");
var query = g._vertices();
query.next();
query.edges();
query.next();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<!-- @endDocuBlock -->

!SUBSECTION Count

<!-- @startDocuBlock JSF_general_graph_fluent_aql_count -->

Returns the number of returned elements if the query is executed.
<br />
This function determines the amount of elements to be expected within the result of the query.
It can be used at the beginning of execution of the query
before using `next()` or in between `next()` calls.
The query object maintains a cursor of the query for you.
`count()` does not change the cursor position.
<br />
@EXAMPLES
<br />
To count the number of matched elements:
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphFluentAQLToArray}
var examples = require("orgarangodbgraph-examplesexample-graph.js");
var g = examples.loadGraph("social");
var query = g._vertices();
query.count();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<!-- @endDocuBlock -->

!SECTION Fluent queries

After the selection of the entry point you can now query your graph in
a fluent way, meaning each of the functions on your query returns the query again.
Hence it is possible to chain arbitrary many executions one after the other.
In this section all available query statements are described.

!SUBSECTION Path

<!-- @startDocuBlock JSF_general_graph_fluent_aql_path -->

The result of the query is the path to all elements.
<br />
By defaut the result of the generated AQL query is the set of elements passing the last matches.
So having a `vertices()` query as the last step the result will be set of vertices.
Using `path()` as the last action before requesting the result
will modify the result such that the path required to find the set vertices is returned.
<br />
@EXAMPLES
<br />
Request the iteratively explored path using vertices and edges:
<br />
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{generalGraphFluentAQLPathSimple}
var examples = require("orgarangodbgraph-examplesexample-graph.js");
var g = examples.loadGraph("social");
var query = g._vertices({name: "Alice"});
query.outEdges().toVertices().path().toArray();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
<br />
When requesting neighbors the path to these neighbors is expanded:
