Edges Index {#GlossaryIndexEdge}
================================

@GE{Edges Index}: An edges index is automatically created for edge collections. It contains connections between vertex documents and is invoked when the connecting edges of a vertex are queried. There is no way to explicitly create or delete edge indexes.
