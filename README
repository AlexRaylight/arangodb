ArangoDB

ArangoDB is a multi-purpose, open-source database with flexible data models for
documents, graphs, and key-values. Build high performance applications using a
convenient SQL-like query language or JavaScript/Ruby extensions. Use ACID
transaction if you require them. Scale horizontally and vertically with a few
mouse clicks.

Key features include:

* Schema-free schemata let you combine the space efficiency of MySQL with the
  performance power of NoSQL
* Use ArangoDB as an application server and fuse your application and database
  together for maximal throughput
* JavaScript for all: no language zoo, you can use one language from your
  browser to your back-end
* ArangoDB is multi-threaded - exploit the power of all your cores
* Flexible data modelling: model your data as combination of key-value pairs,
  documents or graphs - perfect for social relations
* Free index choice: use the correct index for your problem, be it a skip list
  or a fulltext search
* Configurable durability: let the application decide if it needs more
  durability or more performance
* No-nonsense storage: ArangoDB uses all of the power of modern storage
  hardware, like SSD and large caches
* Powerful query language (AQL) to retrieve data
* Transactions: run queries on multiple documents or collections with optional
  transactional consistency and isolation
* Replication and Sharding: set up the database in a master-slave configuration
  or spread bigger datasets across multiple servers
* It is open source (Apache Licence 2.0)

For the Impatient

For Mac OSX users: execute

  brew install arangodb

For Windows and Linux users: use the installer script or distribution package
from our download_page.
If the package manager has not already started the ArangoDB server, use

  unix> /path/to/sbin/arangod
  2012-03-30T12:54:19Z [11794] INFO ArangoDB (version 2.x.y) is ready for
  business
  2012-03-30T12:54:19Z [11794] INFO Have Fun!

/path/to/sbin is OS dependent. It will normally by either /usr/sbin or /user/
local/sbin. Point your browser to

  http://localhost:8529/

and select Tools / JS Shell. You can now use the Arango shell from within your
browser. Alternative, it is available as command-line tool arangosh.

  arangosh> db._create("hello");
  arangosh> db.hello.save({ world: "earth" });

Congratulations! You have created your first collection called hello and your
first document. To verify your achievements, type:

  arangosh> db.hello.toArray();
