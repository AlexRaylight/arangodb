Conventions for testing framework:
==================================

All files in this directory whose name starts with "shell-"
and ends with ".js" automatically take part in server
shell tests (targets "shell_server" and "shell-server-only").

All files in this directory whose name starts with "ahuacatl-"
and ends with ".js" automatically take part in server ahuacatl
tests (target "shell_server_ahuacatl"). Those, whose filename
contains the string "ranges-combined" are only taken if the
flag "skipRanges" in the test options is set to false.

If the filename contains the string "-cluster", then it is
only executed when testing in cluster mode. If the filename
contains the string "-noncluster", then it is only executed
when testing in single instance mode.

If the filename contains the string "-disabled", then it is
not executed at all. This is for tests that cannot be run from the
JavaScript test framework and have to be run from the Makefile.
