Conventions for testing framework:
==================================

All files in this directory whose name starts with "shell-"
and ends with ".js" automatically take part in client and 
server shell tests (targets "shell_client" and "shell_server"
and "shell_server_only").

If the filename contains the string "-cluster", then it is
only executed when testing in cluster mode. If the filename
contains the string "-noncluster", then it is only executed
when testing in single instance mode.
