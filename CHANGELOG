v1.1.x (XXXX-XX-XX)
-------------------
* removed startup options "--server.require-keep-alive" and 
  "--server.secure-require-keep-alive". 
  The server will now behave as follows which should be more conforming to the 
  HTTP standard:
  * if a client sends a "Connection: close" header, the server will close the
    connection
  * if a client sends a "Connection: keep-alive" header, the server will not
    close the connection
  * if a client does not send any "Connection" header, the server will assume
    "keep-alive" if the request was an HTTP/1.1 request, and "close" if the
    request was an HTTP/1.0 request

* internal optimisations for HTTP request parsing and response header handling


v1.x.x (2012-XX-XX)

  collections were always created with journal file sizes of 32 MB and the
  --database.maximal-journal-size setting was ignored

  behavior

* renamed "--unit-tests" to "--javascript.unit-tests"
